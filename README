To Run:
you need sbt :http://www.scala-sbt.org

from the root folder

sbt compile - compiles the source
sbt test - runs the tests
sbt "project fybertimeseries" "run data_scala.txt"

Design:

We use a queue as the data structure to hold a given window.

When receive an update, we push into the queue, and pop off the old values, then propagate the latest window to the stat then printing routines

All this is done from the iteration across the file, so it should be fairly lean in terms of memory use

Issues:

I'm fairly sure there is a slick infix way to do this, but my scala skills aren't confident enough to attempt it and I have a 'javaish' style
It's apparent  to me that they all call each other with more or less a single function.

The doubles are being outputted as 1.60530 instead of 1.6053.
I'm not sure how important this detail is, but if you are testing with string comparison utilities then it might be as it puts the alignments off occasionally.

The column output alignments are also disturbed by rolling sums >= 10.
